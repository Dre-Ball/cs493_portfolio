CS493 Cloud Development SP'21 Portfolio Project
-----------------------------------------------
By: Andre Ballesteros

Final project entailed the creation of very own REST API, using GCP Datastore as the database and GCP to deploy the application.  Please read the documentation pdf for endpoints and further in depth information.

NOTE: As of right now, project is not hosted on GCP as trial version expired after the class finished.  Can be ran locally and using Postman to test endpoints.  Updated version with full-app functionality is in the works.
